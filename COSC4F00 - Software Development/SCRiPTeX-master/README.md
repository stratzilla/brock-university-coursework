# SCRiPTeX

Brock University, COSC 4F00 - Software Development, Final Capstone Project

SCRiPTeX was an attempt at demonstrating a real world application of machine learning. The software was intended to be able to segment handwritten symbols, recognize them as mathematical notation and symbols, and assemble a typeset document.

Documentation for the software throughout it's development, as well as what serves as the final documentation for the software can be found in the root of this repository. The document was originally submitted in a binder, and each "tab section" was originally a stand-alone document.
