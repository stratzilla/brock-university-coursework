# Brock University Coursework

I started a BA in English/linguistics in 2009 and quickly minored in applied computing (APCO courses), which marks the start of my pursuit of computer science.

In 2013 I returned to school, this time for computer science proper. I have since graduated with a BSc in Computer Science but have returned briefly to take more courses part time.

This repository encompasses all of the cumulative work I had done at Brock University as part of my APCO minor and COSC major. As this repository is coursework, it follows a progression from inexperienced to more experienced; some of my earlier work is incomplete or not up to the standard set by later work, particularly the APCO courses. Earlier work might not have comments, and very few projects have execution instructions. Lastly, many comments might pertain to school directly (ie. comments I left for the professor or marker).

This repo is mostly for posterity and my own reference.
