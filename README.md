# Brock University Coursework

I started a BA in English/linguistics in 2009 and quickly minored in applied computing (APCO courses), which marks the start of my pursuit of computer science. In 2013 I returned to school, this time for computer science proper. I have since graduated with a BSc in Computer Science but have returned briefly to take more courses part time.

This repository encompasses all of the cumulative work I had done at Brock University as part of my APCO minor and COSC major. As this repository is coursework, it follows a progression from inexperienced to more experienced; some of my earlier work is incomplete or not up to the standard set by later work, particularly the APCO courses. 

Earlier work might not have comments, and very few projects have execution instructions. As well, many comments might pertain to school directly (ie. comments I left for the professor or marker). Lastly, much of the earlier (Java) work was developed on Windows and only the pertinent source files are included. Whether they can be built as-is is a shot in the dark. Pretty much all of the later work was developed in a Linux environment and usually has some shell script to compile and/or execute.

This repository is mostly for posterity and my own reference.
